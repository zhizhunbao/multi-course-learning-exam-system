% successor/2: the first argument is exactly one larger than the second.

successor(two,   one).
successor(three, two).
successor(four,  three).
successor(five,  four).
successor(six,   five).
successor(seven, six).
successor(eight, seven).

% greater(Y, X) is true if Y is the successor of X,
% or if Y is greater than the successor of X (recursive step).

greater(Y, X) :- successor(Y, X).
greater(Y, X) :- successor(Z, X), greater(Y, Z).
