---

## Form 400: Residential Lease Agreement

### ✅ Compliant Clauses

These clauses comply with Ontario law:

1. **Rent Payment** (Clause 3)

   - Monthly rent $2,300, reasonable for the market
   - Deposit $4,600 = first + last month, complies with RTA
   - **Legal Basis**: RTA s.106(1) - tenant can only pay legally allowed deposits

2. **Term and Automatic Renewal** (Clause 2)

   - Clear term with automatic conversion to month-to-month
   - **Legal Basis**: RTA s.38 - automatic renewal after fixed-term expiry

3. **Standard OREA Form** (Clause 12)
   - Explicitly requires use of RTA-mandated standard lease form
   - **Legal Basis**: RTA s.12(1) - must use government standard lease form

---

### ⚠️ Clauses Requiring Amendment

#### 🔴 **Critical Issue 1: Schedule A, Clause 3 - 7-Day Deficiency Notice**

**Current Clause**:

> "The Tenant agrees to inform the Landlord of any deficiencies in the property within 7 days of possession, failure to do so will be deemed as property found in a good state"

**Problem Analysis**:

- 7 days is too short and violates RTA's reasonable notice requirements
- Landlord has responsibility to ensure property is in good state and cannot escape this through waiver clauses

**Amendment Recommendation**:
Change to: "The Tenant agrees to inform the Landlord of any deficiencies in the property **within 30 days** of possession. The Landlord acknowledges responsibility under the Residential Tenancies Act to maintain the property in a good state of repair."

**Legal Basis**:

- RTA s.20(1): Landlord responsible for maintaining good repair and fit for habitation
- RTA s.94(1): Tenant can request repairs anytime during tenancy
- Consumer Protection Act: Cannot waive statutory rights through unfair terms

---

#### 🟠 **Critical Issue 2: Schedule A, Clause 11 - Assignment/Sublet Fees**

**Current Clause**:

> "In the event that the Landlord consents to such assignment or sublet, the Tenant agrees to be responsible for all necessary charges such as commission / administrative costs for drawing up a new lease **(one month rent +HST)**"

**Problem Analysis**:

- One month rent plus tax as assignment fee is excessive and unreasonable
- Violates RTA restrictions on assignment fees

**Amendment Recommendation**:
Change to: "In the event that the Landlord consents to such assignment or sublet, the Tenant agrees to be responsible for reasonable administrative costs only, not exceeding $100, as permitted by the Residential Tenancies Act."

**Legal Basis**:

- RTA s.95(7): Landlord can only charge reasonable assignment-related fees
- Ontario case law shows fees exceeding $100-200 may be found unreasonable
- LTB guidance: landlords can charge reasonable admin fees but cannot include future rent or commissions

---

#### 🟡 **Moderate Issue 3: Schedule A, Clause 12 - Access Rights**

**Current Clause**:

> "Tenant should not refuse any showing appointments if proper notice is provided"

**Problem Analysis**:

- Language is too absolute and may infringe on tenant's reasonable right to refuse
- Does not specify tenant can refuse due to genuine inconvenience

**Amendment Recommendation**:
Change to: "The Tenant agrees to reasonably cooperate with showings, provided 24 hours written notice is given. The Tenant retains the right to reschedule if the proposed time is genuinely inconvenient."

**Legal Basis**:

- RTA s.26(3): Tenant has right to refuse access during unreasonable times
- RTA s.27(1): Landlord must provide at least 24 hours written notice

---

#### 🟡 **Moderate Issue 4: Schedule A, Clause 17 - Minor Maintenance ($50)**

**Current Clause**:

> "it is the Tenants responsibility for all 'minor' maintenance not exceeding fifty ($50) dollars"

**Problem Analysis**:

- $50 cap is reasonable, but list of items needs clarification on responsibility
- Some items (like filters) need clarity on frequency and cost

**Amendment Recommendation**:
Change to: "The Tenants are responsible for routine maintenance items under $50, including: furnace air filters (every 3 months), light bulbs, batteries for smoke detectors. The Landlord is responsible for furnace system maintenance, HVAC repairs, and any issues exceeding $50."

**Legal Basis**:

- RTA s.20(1): Landlord responsible for maintaining normal state
- RTA s.34: Tenant responsible for repairs caused by normal wear
- LTB case law shows landlords typically responsible for heating systems and plumbing repairs

---

#### 🟢 **Minor Issue 5: Schedule A, Clause 10 - Term Dates**

**Current Clause**:

> "The lease shall commence December 15, 2025 and terminate December 14, 2026 upon which time the tenancy shall become a month to month basis. The first monthly rent payment is due January 15, 2026."

**Problem Analysis**:

- Logic issue: lease starts Dec 15 but first rent payment is Jan 15
- This may imply first month rent was prepaid as deposit

**Amendment Recommendation**:
Clarify: "The lease commences December 15, 2025. The deposit of $4,600 covers the first month (December 15-January 14) and last month rent. Regular monthly payments of $2,300 are due on the 15th of each month starting January 15, 2026."

**Legal Basis**:

- RTA s.106(1)(b): Last month rent must be collected at start of term
- RTA s.119: Rent payments must be on specified dates

---

#### 🟢 **Minor Issue 6: Schedule A, Clause 18 - Extended Absence Notice**

**Current Clause**:

> "The Tenants should inform the Landlord if both of the Tenants leave the premises for more than five days"

**Problem Analysis**:

- This is more of a courtesy request than a legal obligation
- 5-day period is reasonable but needs clarity on whether it's mandatory

**Amendment Recommendation**:
Change to: "The Tenants are requested (but not required by law) to inform the Landlord if all Tenants will be absent for more than five consecutive days. This is for security and emergency contact purposes only."

**Legal Basis**:

- RTA: No legal obligation for tenant to notify of absence
- This is a security suggestion and should not be enforceable as breach

## Form 324: Brokerage Relationship Confirmation

### 📊 Relationship Structure Analysis

**Current Configuration**:

- **Listing Brokerage**: Royal Lepage Team Realty (represents landlord)
- **Co-operating Brokerage**: Royal Lepage Integrity Realty (represents tenants)
- **Commission**: 0.5 months rent + HST ($2,300 × 0.5 = $1,150)
- **Payment**: Paid by landlord through listing brokerage

### ✅ TRESA Compliant

1. **Clear Agency Relationships** (Clause 1)

   - Listing broker represents landlord
   - Co-op broker represents tenants
   - Legal relationships are clear

2. **Commission Disclosure** (Clause 4)
   - 0.5 months rent is industry standard
   - Clear disclosure of who pays commission

**Legal Basis**:

- TRESA s.12: Brokerages must disclose agency relationships
- TRESA s.18: Must confirm representation in writing
- TRESA s.22: Commission terms must be disclosed

## Form 372: Tenant Representation Agreement

### Agreement Summary

- **Duration**: October 30, 2025 9am - December 29, 2025
- **Commission**: 0.5 months rent
- **Holdover Period**: 30 days

### ✅ Main Compliant Points

1. **Exclusive representation clause** - Follows industry standards
2. **Commission structure** - If listing broker pays, no additional tenant cost
3. **Holdover clause** - 30 days is reasonable

### ⚠️ Notable Clauses

#### Holdover Period (Clause 2, 30 days)

**Current Clause**:

> "30 The Tenant agrees to pay the Brokerage such commission if the Tenant enters into an agreement within ................................ days"

**Analysis**:

- 30-day holdover period is relatively long
- Standard is 15-30 days, this is within reasonable range

**Legal Basis**:

- TRESA: Allows reasonable holdover periods
- Must be clearly disclosed and consented to by tenant

**Recommendation**: 30 days is reasonable, but could negotiate down to 15-20 days for future agreements

**No Amendments Required** - Agreement already signed and in effect.
