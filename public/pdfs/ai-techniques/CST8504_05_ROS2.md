The big Picture

- Create Python packages aisd_vision and aisd_motion, use


MediaPipe Hands + OpenCV to detect hand positions and command motion.

- Create aisd_hearing packages using Whisper (STT) and


gTTS (TTS); record audio, transcribe speech.

- Deploy these packages in real application (Create3 robot)

The big Picture OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision Library)
A powerful Python/C++ library for working with images and videos.
Handles low-level tasks like capturing frames from a webcam, resizing, color conversion, drawing, etc.
OpenCV reads the camera stream and provides each frame to the next stage (MediaPipe).
MediaPipe Hands A pre-trained hand-tracking model developed by Google.
Detects 21 key landmarks (fingertips, joints, wrist) for each hand in real time.
Returns normalized (x, y, z) positions of each point in the image.

The big Picture Whisper (Speech-to-Text, STT) An AI speech-recognition model by OpenAI.
Converts spoken audio (from a microphone or WAV file) into written text.
Handles many languages and accents, robust to noise.
In your aisd_hearing package, it turns your voice into text strings.

ROS2 Ecosystem

- ROS2 distributions (version):


[https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Releases.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Releases.html)

- We will use Humble

ROS2 Ecosystem Installations

- [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)
- If you never worked in Ubuntu, take a look at the Linux revision


posted in Brightspace. You need to know basic commands like these

ROS2 Ecosystem

- After you install ROS2 humble distribution, check if it working or not. If you


type ROS2 and then double tab you will see a list commands can be used.

- Try ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker ,,,This will run a C++ node called


Talker inside a C++ Package called demo_nodes_cpp. The node will publish Hello World every second.

ROS2 Ecosystem

- Now in anther terminal you can type ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener.


This will run a C++ node that will listen to the published message and Type “I heard:….”

Building Packages in ROS2

- We will use a Library called Colcon.
- [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-)


Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html

- Install Colcon as follows

Building Packages in ROS2

- Every workspace can have serval packages. Each package


contains modules (codes that send and receives messages).

- You can build package a package called my_py_pkg using ament


as follows:

- Note that you need rclpy to be able to write pyhton codes.

Building Packages in ROS2

- Now check that your Python Package was build.
- You need to redo “colcon build” every time you install or update


any of the packages inside the workspace.
