## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Winter 2026 cohort roles with Algonquin College’s Applied Research (AI) Accelerator Hub (AI Hub). As a candidate currently completing Algonquin College’s Artificial Intelligence Software Development graduate certificate (2025–2026) and a seasoned full-stack developer, I bring over a decade of experience delivering production-grade systems from data pipelines to accessible web applications. The AI Hub’s mandate to prototype AI-powered solutions for real-world stakeholders aligns with the initiatives I lead today—especially my Ottawa GenAI Research Assistant and Multi-Course Learning & Exam System projects.

- I have architected large-scale data platforms processing 50+ TB of data monthly, integrating Spark, CDH, DolphinScheduler, and REST APIs to power regulatory reporting and executive analytics—experience that translates directly to the Hub’s full-stack projects.
- My recent work combines FastAPI backends (88.8% test coverage) with React, Vite, and Tailwind frontends. I deliver component-driven, accessible interfaces, conduct audits, and maintain CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Terraform across Render, AWS, and GitHub Pages.
- AI is a core focus: I integrate Groq, Google Gemini, and retrieval-augmented generation patterns, and I am exploring agentic workflows and LangChain, orchestrating LLM-powered user journeys end to end.
- Soft skills matter: I have led agile teams, mentored developers, facilitated stakeholder workshops, and deliver bilingual (EN/Mandarin) user experiences, drawing on my professional roots in China and current studies in Ottawa.

I am motivated by the AI Hub’s emphasis on equitable, accessible AI adoption. I would welcome the chance to contribute my hybrid expertise in AI engineering, DevOps, and user-centric design to accelerate your Winter projects.

Thank you for your consideration. My résumé is attached, and I am available at your convenience for an interview. I can be reached at 753-881-8089 or wang1059@algonquinlive.com.

Sincerely,
Peng Wang
