**Re: AI Backend Developer Co-op Position - Winter 2025**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the AI Backend Developer Co-op position at Intact Lab. As a graduate student pursuing Artificial Intelligence Software Development at Algonquin College with 10+ years of experience in data engineering and full-stack development, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Intact's mission of transforming customer experience through innovative AI solutions.

**Alignment with Position Requirements**

Your position demands expertise in Python, Java, Docker/Kubernetes, and modern backend technologies—all areas where I have extensive hands-on experience. Throughout my career as a Data Architect at Guangzhou Huanwang Technology, I architected and maintained comprehensive big data platforms processing 50+ TB monthly, using Spring Boot, Docker, and distributed systems to ensure 99.9% uptime. I led cloud infrastructure optimization, implementing automated monitoring and CI/CD pipelines.

**Relevant Technical Expertise**

In my current studies at Algonquin College, I have actively applied these technologies to real-world AI projects. Most notably, I led the development of the Ottawa GenAI Research Assistant, a government collaboration project where I architected a FastAPI backend with 88.8% test coverage, integrated Groq AI and Google Gemini for intelligent content generation, and deployed a microservices architecture on Render with CI/CD validation. This project demonstrates my ability to design, test, and develop backend solutions for AI teams—exactly the core responsibility of your position.

Additionally, I have built multiple full-stack applications using Python, Java, React, and modern cloud technologies, including a Multi-Course Learning & Exam System that leverages Google Gemini API for AI-powered content generation. I am proficient in Python and Java programming, with practical experience in Docker/Kubernetes and agile methodologies such as Scrum.

**Cultural Fit and Growth Mindset**

I am particularly drawn to Intact Lab's culture of innovation, where exploration and continuous learning are valued. The opportunity to work alongside talented engineers on AI solutions that serve millions of Canadians aligns perfectly with my passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. My experience leading cross-functional agile teams and mentoring developers has prepared me to collaborate effectively in a fast-paced, innovative environment.

**Availability and Commitment**

I am available to work full-time (35 hours per week) for the Winter 2025 term (January – April) and am enthusiastic about the prospect of growing with the Intact family. I am eager to bring my technical expertise, collaborative mindset, and dedication to supporting AI teams in developing innovative backend solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my background in AI development, backend engineering, and full-stack solutions can contribute to the success of Intact Lab.

Sincerely,

**Peng Wang**
