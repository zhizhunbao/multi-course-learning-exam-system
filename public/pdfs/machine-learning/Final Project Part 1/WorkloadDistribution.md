Workload Distribution (include filled-in table in project plan of your report)



Each task must be completed individually, so do not assign more than one student name to a single task. Additionally, refer to your lab and Brightspace materials to identify the required subtasks for each model. Each student is responsible for documenting every step performed by them in the report.



Even though it is a group project, as each task is individual, there won’t be any group mark, each student will be evaluated according to the completeness and quality of their work.



Don’t write in greyed-out cells – those tasks are individual tasks.



Every task has Data preparation, Modelling & Evaluation & Interpretation of results, however all of these sub-tasks must be performed by the same person who is in charge of that task.
